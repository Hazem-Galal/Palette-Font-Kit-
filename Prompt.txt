Role
You are an expert front-end engineer and UX designer. You write clean, accessible, production-ready HTML/CSS/JavaScript for static websites (no build tools, no frameworks).

You anticipate edge cases, document decisions in comments, and keep the UI neutral so generated aesthetics are the focus.

Task
Build a static “Random Aesthetic Generator” that produces cohesive color palettes and font pairings.

It must:

Generate a 4–6 color palette and display HEX values with copy-to-clipboard on click.
Generate a heading/body font pairing (from Google Fonts), load them dynamically, and render a live preview (H1 + paragraph + button sample).
Shuffle both with one action (button + keyboard shortcut).
Let users Save/Favorite combinations (palette + fonts) to localStorage, list them, re-apply them, and delete them.
Export the current combination as:
CSS variables (copy block)
JSON (download or copy)
Be responsive, accessible (WCAG AA contrast checks shown inline), and polished (subtle transitions).
Provide light/dark UI modes (toggle) without affecting generated colors or preview background (keep preview neutral).
Start with 3 curated defaults — “Minimal”, “Playful”, and “Bold” — so the page doesn’t load empty.
Context
Primary audience: hiring managers and recruiters evaluating polish and range.
Secondary audience: designers and developers who may actually use the tool.

Design System for the UI Chrome (not the generated output)
Neutral background:
Light: #f9fafb
Dark: #1e1e1e
One accent (e.g., indigo #6366f1) for controls
Card-based layout, generous spacing, rounded corners, soft shadow
UI fonts: Inter (headings) + Source Sans 3 or Roboto (body) for the app shell only
Generated Preview
Shows the chosen pairing applied to a headline, subhead, paragraph, and sample button
Palette swatches displayed in a row (or wrapped on mobile) with HEX labels and copy affordances
Contrast checker:
For each swatch, compute contrast ratio vs. white and vs. black
Mark pass/fail badges for AA normal text (WCAG 2.1)
Engineering Notes
Static only (no server): use client-side JS and Google Fonts CSS (inject <link> for selected families & weights)
Keep a small curated list of Google Fonts (10–20 families) with known good pairings; randomize from that set to ensure quality
Keyboard shortcuts:
Space = Shuffle
S = Save current
C = Copy CSS variables
LocalStorage keys:
aesthetic.favorites (array)
aesthetic.settings (theme preference)
Animations: fade/slide of swatches and preview; 150–250ms; prefers-reduced-motion respected
Copy utilities: use navigator.clipboard.writeText with fallbacks
Constraints
Delivery
Deliver a pure static solution: one index.html with embedded <style> and <script>
No build steps, no external JS frameworks, no CSS frameworks
Accessibility
Semantic HTML (landmarks, labels), focus states, tab order, and ARIA where needed
Contrast check badges must be screen-reader friendly
Buttons and interactive swatches must be keyboard navigable and show focus rings
Performance
Lazy-load Google Fonts only when selected (avoid loading entire set upfront)
No blocking JS; defer script; minimize layout thrash
Code Quality
Clear sections and comments
Small, pure functions:
getRandomPalette, pickFontPair, applyFonts, renderPalette, renderPreview, saveFavorite, loadFavorites, exportCSSVars, exportJSON, checkContrast
No third-party JS dependencies
UI Neutrality
The app shell must never override or normalize the generated palette or preview beyond layout
The generated results are the focus
Format
Return exactly three code blocks representing files:

1) index.html
Includes the full page markup with inline <style> and <script>
Loads Inter + Source Sans 3 (or Roboto) for the UI
Contains:
Header: title + dark/light toggle
Main area:
a. Controls (Shuffle, Save, Copy CSS, Export JSON)
b. Palette card (swatches with HEX + copy)
c. Font pairing card (family names + live preview)
d. Favorites panel (list of saved combos with re-apply/delete)
Footer: tiny note about keyboard shortcuts and license
2) <style> (inside the same index.html)
Modern, minimal CSS: CSS variables, container widths, grid layout, focus styles
Dark mode via .theme-dark on <html>
Transition rules and @media (prefers-reduced-motion)
3) <script> (inside the same index.html)
Self-contained JS implementing all behaviors:
Curated font list
Sample palettes
Contrast checker (WCAG 2.1 formula)
LocalStorage handling
Clipboard utilities
Keyboard shortcuts
Dynamic Google Fonts <link> injection
Acceptance Criteria (must pass on first render)
Page loads with “Minimal” default applied
Shuffle works (fonts + palette change together)
Copying a swatch copies its HEX
Copy CSS copies --color-1..n vars and font families
Export JSON provides a valid object:
{ "palette": [...], "fonts": { "heading": "...", "body": "..." } }
Saving adds to Favorites; clicking a favorite re-applies it; delete works
Contrast badges correctly show AA pass/fail vs. white and black for each swatch
Fully responsive down to 320px
Keyboard shortcuts and tab navigation work
Dark/light toggle persists across reloads
Additional Note
Include helpful inline comments explaining non-obvious logic and any trade-offs.
